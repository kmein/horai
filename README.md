# Ὧραι – `horai`

`horai` is a simple work hours logger for the command line.
To begin tracking your time on a project,
run `horai project-name start`.
This will create a file called `project-name`
containing the date and time
you ran the command.

When you want to take a break
or are done for the day,
just run `horai project-name stop`.
This will add a second date-time to the file.

In case you want a report on how long you've been working,
run `horai project-name`,
and be greeted by a table of work units and their duration,
with the total duration at the bottom.
